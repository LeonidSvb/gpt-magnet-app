# Outdoorable TripGuide Widget

**TL;DR:** For outdoor travelers, build an embeddable widget (Webflow) that generates a personalized Trip Guide and connects them with the right expert, so they can plan their trip faster and with confidence.

---

## Users & Value

- **Primary user / persona:** Outdoor enthusiasts (mainly from US/EU) looking to plan trips more efficiently.  
- **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD):**
  - When I don’t know where to travel, I want tailored recommendations, so I can choose a destination.  
  - When I already know where I want to go, I want a clear, structured guide, so I can plan my trip smoothly.  
  - When I’m exploring options, I want to easily connect with a local expert, so I can get trusted advice.  

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** Users receive a personalized Trip Guide, leave their e-mail, and get matched with an expert.  
- **Success Criteria:**  
  - % of users who complete the questionnaire → receive a Trip Guide (target: >50%)  
  - % of users who submit e-mail (target: >30%)  
  - % of users who view expert card (target: >20%)

## Scope

| Must-have (MVP)                                                                 | Nice-to-have (Later)                        | Explicitly Out (Not now)              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Two flows: *Inspire Me* and *I Know Where to Go*                                 | Calendar integration (Calendly links)       | Native mobile app                     |
| Trip Guide generation via OpenAI (formatted for readability)                     | Expert video messages (Loom, async consult) | Complex marketplace functionality     |
| Partial access to Trip Guide (50%) until e-mail is submitted                     | Payments integration                        | Social network/community features     |
| Collect e-mail + answers → send to GoHighLevel CRM                               | Expert reviews & rating system              | VR/AR features                        |
| Expert matching via Airtable (tags + OpenAI selection logic)                     | A/B testing of flows and copy               | Offline events                        |
| Easy embed in Webflow, responsive for mobile & desktop                           | AI-driven chat with expert                  |                                       |

- **Definition of Done (MVP):**
  - [ ] User can complete one of the two flows.  
  - [ ] Personalized Trip Guide is generated and displayed in a clean format.  
  - [ ] After ~50% scroll, user is prompted to submit e-mail.  
  - [ ] E-mail + answers are successfully sent to GoHighLevel.  
  - [ ] Expert card (from Airtable) is displayed with avatar, name, description, and link.  
  - [ ] Widget runs without critical bugs on Webflow (desktop + mobile).

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React (Next.js on Vercel for deployment)  
- Existing CSS design (from previous iteration) adapted for the widget  
- Tailwind optional (only if needed for responsiveness/adaptation)  

### Backend:
- Vercel Functions (Node.js)  
- OpenAI API → generate Trip Guide + tagging for expert matching  
- Airtable API → query experts based on tags  
- GoHighLevel API → store e-mails and user answers  

### Database:
- None. GoHighLevel CRM is the **only source of truth** for user data.  
- Airtable is the source of truth for expert directory.

## Open Questions

1. **Monetization:** Should MVP already include CTA to book a paid consultation with experts?  
2. **Trip Guide format:** Text-only, or enriched with maps/links (Google Maps, AllTrails, etc.)?  
3. **Expert card content:** Minimum set (avatar, name, description, link) — add pricing/availability now or later?  
4. **Follow-up:** After e-mail submission, do we send guide/summary via e-mail automatically, or keep it inside the widget only for MVP?  
5. **Frontend stack:** Stick with Next.js + Vercel for consistency, or simplify with pure React embed since Webflow is the host?
